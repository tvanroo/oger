The "MM-DD-YY" at the end of the filename governs if a new version is downloaded and deployed. If saving changes you want implemented, ensure the date is changed to the current date.

This script is grabbed by the silent-launcher.ps1 script set to run at each user login. that launcherwon't download a changed version of this file unless the date is changed. Only the latest date will be used.
